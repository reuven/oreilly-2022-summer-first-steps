    "1. Loops\n",
    "    - `for` loop -- go over every element of an item each time (string, list, or tuple)\n",
    "    - `for` loop has a body, and it can contain any code at all -- `if`, `for`, `print`, `input`\n",
    "    - `while` loops run until the condition is `False`, sort of like `if`, but it doesn't only run once\n",
    "    - You use `for` loops when you know how many times you want to do something -- once for each element of a string/list/tuple.  You use `while` loops when you don't know how many times you want to do something, but you know when you want to stop.\n",
    "    - If you want to loop a number of times, you can use the `range` builtin.  If you say `range(5)`, then you'll loop 5 times, getting the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n",

    "for one_item in 'abcd':    # iterate over a string\n",
